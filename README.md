# Grove

Minimal workspace manager for AI coding agents (Rust + FrankenTUI).

Grove helps you run many agent tasks in parallel, each in its own git worktree and tmux session, with one fast keyboard-first TUI.

## What Grove Is

Grove is a focused workspace manager for AI coding agents, built with Rust and FrankenTUI.

It is built for a single job: manage isolated coding workspaces, launch agents, monitor output live, and clean up safely.

## What Grove Supports

- Git worktree lifecycle, create, edit, merge, update-from-base, delete
- Agent runtime per workspace via tmux sessions (persistent across TUI restarts)
- Supported agents, Claude Code and Codex
- Interactive mode inside the TUI (send keys directly to running sessions)
- Live output preview with ANSI rendering and cursor-aware display
- Git preview tab via `lazygit`
- Workspace status detection (idle, active, thinking, waiting, done, error)
- Multi-project switching from config
- Mouse support (selection, scroll, pane resize)
- Command palette + keybind help modal
- Event logs and debug record stream for diagnostics

## Scope (Intentional)

- Single-repo workflow per active project
- tmux-only multiplexer support
- No plugin system
- No issue tracker / kanban features
- No PR automation layer

## Requirements

Required binaries on `PATH`:

- `git`
- `tmux`
- `lazygit`

Rust toolchain is required to build from source.

Quick check:

```bash
command -v git tmux lazygit
```

## Install

### Option 1, Nix dev shell

```bash
nix develop
cargo build
```

### Option 2, plain Cargo

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Binary path:

```bash
target/release/grove
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# optional, install hooks
lefthook install

# run quality gates
make ci

# run app
cargo run
```

Inside Grove:

- `n` new workspace
- `s` start agent
- `Enter` open preview / interactive attach (context dependent)
- `x` stop agent
- `m` merge workspace branch into base
- `u` update workspace from base
- `D` delete workspace
- `p` open project switcher
- `S` settings
- `Ctrl+K` command palette
- `?` keybind help
- `q` quit

## CLI Flags

- `--print-hello`, sanity check output path
- `--event-log <path>`, write event log to explicit file
- `--debug-record`, write continuous debug record to `.grove/debug-record-*.jsonl`

Example:

```bash
cargo run -- --debug-record
tail -f .grove/debug-record-*.jsonl
```

## Configuration

Config file path:

- Linux/macOS: `~/.config/grove/config.toml` (via XDG when available)

Current config model includes:

- `multiplexer` (currently `tmux`)
- `projects` list (name + path)

Example:

```toml
multiplexer = "tmux"

[[projects]]
name = "grove"
path = "/path/to/repo"
```

## Development Commands

```bash
make fmt
make clippy
make test
make ci
```

## Credits

Grove's workflow and UX direction were heavily inspired by [Sidecar](https://github.com/marcus/sidecar), which was the main reference for session lifecycle, interaction model, and overall operator experience.

Also built on [FrankenTUI](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankentui).
