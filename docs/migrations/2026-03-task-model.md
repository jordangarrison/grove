# Task Model Migration

Grove now treats a `task` as the top-level unit.

- `workspace` -> `task`
- `project` -> `repository`
- `worktree` now means one repository checkout inside a task
- each task lives under `~/.grove/tasks/<task-slug>/`
- task metadata lives in `~/.grove/tasks/<task-slug>/.grove/task.toml`
- parent agent sessions use `grove-task-<task-slug>`
- repository worktree sessions use `grove-wt-<task-slug>-<repository>`

Behavior changes:

- creating from the TUI creates one task, with one or more repository worktrees
- refresh reloads task manifests from the task root only
- Home-tab launch, stop, and preview operate on the task-root parent agent
- session cleanup now targets both task-root and worktree sessions
- tmux session families are task-native, `grove-task-*` and `grove-wt-*`
